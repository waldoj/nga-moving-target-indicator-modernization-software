## STANAGs

This RFQ cites two “STANAGs,” or NATO STANdardization AGreements, that this work relies on: STANAG 4607 and STANAG 4676. These function like ISO or ANSI standards, but are instead promulgated by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. There are [STANAGs on many topics](http://nso.nato.int/nso/nsdd/listpromulg.html), some technical, most not. The work here requires parsing both of these STANAG file formats.

### STANAG 4607
4607 defines the NATO [Ground Moving Target Indicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_target_indication) (GMTI) format—radar, basically. The NATO Standards Office publishes both [the standard itself](http://nso.nato.int/nso/zPublic/stanags/CURRENT/4607Eed03.pdf) and [an implementation guide](http://nso.nato.int/nso/zPublic/ap/aedp-7(2).pdf). MITRE publishes [an interesting history](https://www.mitre.org/sites/default/files/pdf/05_0164.pdf) of how the 4607 standard came to be. To get an idea of what it looks like to interact with GMTI [see this open source GMTI library](https://github.com/pentlandedge/s4607), [these open source GMTI utilities](https://github.com/pentlandedge/s4607_extra), or [this Leaflet-based GMTI viewer](http://www.hawkstream.net/), which includes sample data.

### STANAG 4676
4676 is the NATO Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Tracking Standard, establishing the standard for tracking the location and spatial movement of mobile objects and associated motion imagry. [The standard](http://nso.nato.int/nso/zPublic/ap/AEDP-12(A)V1.pdf) defines an XML schema.
