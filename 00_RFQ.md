## 1.0 PURPOSE

The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), Office of Contract Services (OCS), hereby issues this Request for Quote (RFQ) to procure services in support of the attached Statement of Objectives (SOO). This solicitation will be accomplished using the terms and conditions of the RFQ and of the offeror’s Master Contract under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contract, Schedule 70, General Purpose Commercial Information Technology Equipment, Software, and Services, under Special Item Number (SIN) 132 51.

## 2.0 BACKGROUND

NGA intends to retire its current traditional data center and replace it with a cloud-based computing environment. This necessitates migrating motion imagery data — MTI, Video, Wide Area Motion Imagery, and the associated operational capabilities to the cloud.

## 3.0 SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES

## 3.1 Scope

The scope of this effort is to develop capabilities to ingest, discover, retrieve and visualize MTI data (STANAG 4607, STANAG 4676, and mission data) in the cloud across multiple security domains. To fulfill the objectives for performance of this task order, the Vendor must meet the user needs described in the following subsections. Please note that, in subsequent sprints, we may refine these objectives to ensure we are continually meeting user needs. In agreement with the product owner, we may modify, add, retract, or reprioritize elements from the backlog.

**3.1.2 Develop capabilities using agile software development practices:** The offeror shall deliver capabilities defined by epics and user stories managed from an evolving and prioritized program backlog. The program backlog shall be established and maintained by the Government-assigned product owner in collaboration with the offeror’s agile development team.

**3.1.3 Deliver on Demand:** Deployments of production release candidates shall occur on a cadence established by the Government-assigned product owner.

**3.1.4 Offeror and Integrator DevOps Collaboration:** The offeror shall collaborate with a Government-assigned Integrator team to ensure the streamlined and successful deployment, integration, and ongoing support of production releases into SC2S. The Government-assigned product owner shall approve deployment of production release candidates. The Integrator shall complete the security C&amp;A process, deploy approved production releases into SC2S, and lead user acceptance testing activities. Collaboration between the offeror and Integrator shall span across design, development, and testing activities performed prior to SC2S deployments as well as deployment and post-deployment activities as deemed necessary and appropriate. The offeror and Integrator shall collaborate in attaining Authority to Test (ATT) and Authority to Operate (ATO) on SC2S. The offeror and Integrator shall collaborate to ensure that all Solution code, testing, and documentation artifacts comply with all pertinent governance mandates and meet the level of quality necessary to achieve successful integration, operation, and maintenance of offeror-developed software capabilities in SC2S.

## 9.0 EVALUATION AND BASIS FOR AWARD

**9.1 Evaluation Process**

The final award for this requirement will be based on best-value principles, utilizing the trade-off process. Accordingly, award will be made to the responsible and technically acceptable offeror whose quotation provides the greatest overall value to the Government, price and other factors considered.

The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical capabilities than with making awards at the lowest overall price to the Government. However, the Government will not make awards at a significantly higher overall price to achieve slightly superior technical value. Offerors are advised that the technical evaluation factors combined are significantly more important than price.

**The evaluation factors for award are as follows in descending order of importance:**

- Factor 1: Staffing Plan
- Factor 2: Technical Understanding and Approach
- Factor 3: Similar Experience
- Factor 4: Price

**9.1.1 Technical Evaluation**

We will review your responses to ensure they demonstrate an understanding of the requirements outlined in the proposed PWS, particularly Section 3, and the strength of the proposed development expertise, agile practices, and implementation of UX design. For each requested section, the Government will review the following:

- **Staffing Plan:** The Government will evaluate the offeror’s proposed staffing methodology and skill levels/labor categories as well as the availability and relevant work experience demonstrated by Key Personnel.
- **Technical Understanding and Approach:** The Government will evaluate the offeror’s technical approach: level of knowledge, technical expertise, and overall understanding of the requirement. The Government will also evaluate the offeror’s skills with open source software development, human-centered design, and continuous deployment methods.
- **Similar Experience:** The Government will evaluate the offeror’s experience in performing projects of similar scope and complexity. The Government will also evaluate the offeror’s experience with open source software development, human-centered design, and continuous deployment methods.

**9.1.2 Price Evaluation**

Each offeror’s price quotation will be evaluated separately from the technical response. Note that as submissions become more technically equal in their merit, the evaluated price becomes more important.

## 10.0 BASIS FOR AWARD

The final award for this requirement will be based on best-value principles per FAR 8.405-2. Accordingly, award will be made to the responsible and technically acceptable offeror whose quote provides the greatest overall value to the Government, price and other factors considered.

This best-value determination will be accomplished by comparing the value of the differences in the technical factors for competing offers under consideration in the technical evaluation, based on their strengths, weaknesses, and risks, with differences in their price to the Government.

In making this comparison, the Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical and management capabilities than with making awards at the lowest overall price to the Government. However, the Government will not make awards at a significantly higher overall price to achieve slightly superior technical value. Offerors are advised that the technical evaluation factors combined are significantly more important than price.


## 11.0 CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION

### 11.1 KEY PERSONNEL

Key personnel and staffing requirements will be defined at the TO level. The name and resume of key personnel shall be designated in writing to the CO for approval. Prior to removing, replacing, or diverting any key personnel, the Offeror shall notify the CO no less than fifteen (15) calendar days in advance and shall submit a proposed replacement for Government review within fifteen (15) days of notification. The Government retains the right, at its discretion, to reject any proposed replacements of key personnel.
